DATA Set: UNC/UMN Baby Connectome Project

Why: The infant brain experiences rapid growth in the first few years of life. Recently, Integrated Information Decomposition was developed to quantify human brain information-processing. Precisely delineating the normative functional development of this critical period from the information-processing view may reveal distinct information-resolved connectivity patterns. 
Objective:  Developmental patterns of nodal information attributes are spatially heterogeneous and regionally specific, which could reflect unique functional roles of different regions. Certain brain regionsâ€™ developmental attributes are associated with early cognitive ability.

Thanks for review my project!
