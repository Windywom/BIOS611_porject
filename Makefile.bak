# Here we train and serialize an auto-encoder (and an encoder) for the
# state of patients (regardless of time). The encoder projects patient
# state down to 2 dimensions. Hopefully this projection allows us to
# understand their progress in a simple way. In practice it turns out
# that this encoder just encodes average pain, so we don't find it all
# that useful.
